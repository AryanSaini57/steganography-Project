# 🛡️ Steganography-Based Secure Message Hiding 🎭

This project implements **image steganography** using **Python and OpenCV** to securely hide messages inside images. The encoded message can only be retrieved with the correct **password**, ensuring **confidentiality and security**.

---

## 🚀 Features  
✅ **Hide Messages in Images** – Encrypts text inside pixel values  
✅ **Password Protection** – Only authorized users can decrypt the message  
✅ **Lightweight & Fast** – Uses OpenCV & NumPy for efficiency  
✅ **Supports JPEG & PNG Formats** – Works with common image types  
✅ **Cross-Platform Compatibility** – Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python 3.x**  
- **OpenCV** – Image processing  
- **NumPy** – Efficient data manipulation

## 📌 Installation & Setup  

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AryanSaini57/steganography-Project.git
cd steganography-Project

🔹 2️⃣ Install Dependencies
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
If requirements.txt is missing, install dependencies manually:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install opencv-python numpy
🔹 3️⃣ Run the Script
bash
Copy
Edit
python stego.py
📝 How It Works
🔹 Hiding a Message
1️⃣ The program loads an image
2️⃣ User enters a secret message & password
3️⃣ The message is encoded inside image pixels
4️⃣ The encrypted image is saved

🔹 Retrieving a Message
1️⃣ The encrypted image is loaded back
2️⃣ User enters the correct password
3️⃣ The hidden message is extracted and displayed

📷 Screenshots
(Add screenshots of the original image, encrypted image, and decryption output here)

🔮 Future Enhancements
🚀 Support for Video & Audio Steganography
🚀 GUI-Based Interface for Ease of Use
🚀 Advanced Encryption (AES) for Additional Security
🚀 Mobile App Integration for Secure Messaging

### **✅ What’s Improved?**  
🚀 **All commands are inside proper `bash` code blocks** → Users can easily **copy-paste**  
🚀 **Keeps `pip install` commands separate** in case `requirements.txt` is missing  
🚀 **Improved clarity & organization**  

Now you can simply **copy & paste** this into your **README.md** file in GitHub! 🚀🔥 Let me know if you need further modifications. 😊
